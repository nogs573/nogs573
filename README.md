- 👋 Hi, I’m @nogs573. I'm Canadian, and graduated with my bachelor in Comp Sci in June 2022. I have experience 
  living and working in Japan. I speak English and French fluently, as well as a considerable amount of Japanese.
- 👀 I’m interested in the future of cloud, web applications, and game development.
- 🌱 Interested in work opportunities in Canada for the moment. Would seriously consider a move back to Japan as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams, as well as any project where I could learn from more
  experienced programmers.
- 📫 How to reach me: Please shoot me an email at nathangagne.dev@gmail.com
